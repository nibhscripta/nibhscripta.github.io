        <h1>Ethylene Plants in the United States</h1>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">7 September 2024</p>
        <h2>General Overview</h2>
        <p>Ethylene is an important monomer used for the production of many plastic resins and basic chemicals. Worldwide production is on the order of 150 million tons annually. It is produced by the pyrolysis or cracking of light hydrocarbons or alkanes. Typically, US ethylene producers use ethane derived from natural gas as a feedstock. Ethane is mixed with steam and fed to large furnaces called crackers. The process is referred to as "steam cracking". At high temperature, >2000Â°F, ethane breaks down into ethylene. The outlet of the cracker is quickly cooled and quenched to limit the further breakdown of the hydrocarbons. This process also produces byproducts such as propylene and butadiene. These byproducts are separated from ethylene by distillation. Pure, 99.9 wt%, ethylene and propylene are sold. Unreacted ethane is recycled back to the cracker.</p>
        <p>Numerous companies operate steam crackers in the US. Below is a list of these companies:</p>
